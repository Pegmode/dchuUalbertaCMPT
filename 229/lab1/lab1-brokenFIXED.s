# Something doesn't work. This code should check
# to see if the string in Str is a palindrome.
# (A palindrome is a string that is equivalent
# to the reverse of itself.
# example of a palindrome: noon
# example that is NOT a palindrome: racecars)
#
# The string address is in s0
# Reverse is in s1
