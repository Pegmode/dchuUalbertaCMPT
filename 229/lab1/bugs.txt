Errors:
  - line 78: attempt to store t0 as word when it has been loaded as a byte
    - I have corrected it to be only bytes (sb)

  - Line 95: opposite conditional of whats needed. We only want to exit the checkLoop and flag the string
  as not a palindrome if the 2 entires are not equivalent
    - I have corrected it to branch if not equal (bne)

  - line 100: Since I decided we are working in bytes in the error correction in line 78
  we only need to advance the s1 register containing the address by 1.
    -changed to immediate add by 1 (addi s1,s1,1)
