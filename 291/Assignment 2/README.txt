Questions 1-2 done

Spent hours trying to figure out the others. I've given up as I've worked on this for a few days and will look over the solutions
once they're released.

Largest issue is how do I deal with all these many to one relations? I have no idea how to cross reference
all these tables and both the notes and everything I find online is either too simple or doesn't
explain anything at all. Maybe I am just missing something but I feel extremely lost with a lot of this.
